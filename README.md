# mcMusic

This is a project dedicated to my girlfriend, Muchen Yu.
She is a very talented pianoist, and six months ago she composed a piano piece for me for my 19th birthday, so I thought, why not created a website to store her music? 
I am planning to build the site with node.js and express in the backend for user login and database storage, possibly react or angular for front end, and materailizeCSS for design.
Hopefully I can finish this project before our anniversary :)
