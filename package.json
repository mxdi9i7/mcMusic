  "description": "This is a project dedicated to my girlfriend, Muchen Yu. She is a very talented pianoist, and six months ago she composed a piano piece for me for my 19th birthday, so I thought, why not created a website to store her music?  I am planning to build the site with node.js and express in the backend for user login and database storage, possibly react or angular for front end, and materailizeCSS for design. Hopefully I can finish this project before our anniversary :)",
